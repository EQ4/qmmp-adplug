This is a plugin for Qmmp which supports AdLib file formats using AdPlug
(http://adplug.github.io/).

The following packages are required, including development headers,
which some vendors split into separate packages:

• qmmp
• adplug
• qt4

To build, run Qt4's qmake (often installed as qmake-qt4) and then build
with make:

$ qmake-qt4
$ make

To install:

$ make install

This installs the plugin into Qmmp's input plugin directory.  To install
to a staging area, such as for packaging:

$ make install INSTALL_ROOT=/path/to/staging
